On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 1 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:

I am not sure if I am reviewing the final code for the ChatServer, but I did not find any other ChatServer.java "like" documents in the repository. Anyway, after looking at this code it seems unfinished because not much has changed from the original UDPServer program. The program doesn't compile and has errors. The Blue.java and Red.java seem more finished, but the ChatServer.java program seems like it needs some work.
